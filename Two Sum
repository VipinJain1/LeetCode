Given an array of integers, return indices of the two numbers such that they add up to a specific target.

You may assume that each input would have exactly one solution, and you may not use the same element twice.

Example:

Given nums = [2, 7, 11, 15], target = 9,

Because nums[0] + nums[1] = 2 + 7 = 9,
return [0, 1].

class Solution:
    def twoSum(self, nums: List[int], target: int) -> List[int]: 
        found = 0
        for i in range(len(nums)):
            if (target - nums[i] in nums[i+1:]):
                found =1
                index =   len(nums)- nums[::-1].index(target - nums[i])-1
                return [i, index]

        if found == 0:
            return None
